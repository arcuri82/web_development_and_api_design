# Quiz Game - Part 03

In this exercise, the goal is to replace the `index.js` file with a `index.jsx`
using *React* and *React-Dom*.
The JS in such file needs to be modified to use *React*.
Such libraries need to be added as well to the `package.json` file.
You will also likely need to update the `index.html` file. 

Because JSX is not JS, you need to use *Babel* (e.g., with `react` preset)
to transform the JSX code when it is bundled with *WebPack*.

`quizzes.js` should be left as it is, with the test cases still working correctly
with *Jest*. 

Solutions to this exercise can be found under the *exercise-solutions* folder.
